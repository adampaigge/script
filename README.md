Script
=================

The goal of Supernova Labs script is to bring together expertise over the past 17 years of crypto development to establish a new, extensible interface between humanity, machines and non-human intelligences. 

Imagine a world in which the velocity of money and data is able to operate at its fastest. Money has only ever been the base layer of cryptocurrency, and it's ability to store and deploy smart contracts between parties both human and non-human, we believe, is it's ultimate purpose as a well resolved technology in our world.

We are looking to forgoe a lot of the trappings of most crypto projects, although we will not be immune to the market dynamics and hype cycles associated with them once they are a tradable asset; we will not be able to prevent this. However our mission is to create the substrate on which the next evolution of civilisation transacts and interconnects.  

What is Script?
---------------------

Script is a Peer-2-Peer transaction protocol for the internet, intranets and mesh networks in what ever form they may take at global scale.

Peer-to-peer technology is a means to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money/data carried out collectively by the network (that means you, your friends, that cute cafe you like and more). There are many ways to engage with this, whether by downloading the entire transaction database and operating as a node in the network, meaning you help secure and act as a source of truth for the network, or you can download wallets and use it as a currency or in your projects as decentralised API layer token where transparency and accountability are required. 

All transactions are posted to a public ledger, and while the wallet addresses may be pseudonomymous (like a handle on a social media site) they are not anonymous once you link IPs, identifying information and more to your wallet and transactions. This is fine in some cases, but we will work to make sure there are options for encrypted transactions in future to make this safe for every day use. 

The model should be as follows, transparency and accountability for trusted authorities and governance, privacy for the rest of us.

Development Process
-------------------

This Github repository contains the source code of releases. Feel free to contribute through Pull Request. We are looking for talented UTXO coin developers and people with prior experience in sCrypt (bitcoin smart contracting language). The underlying code is a blend of bitcoin & dogecoin yet greater than the sum of their parts. It should reflect the tried and tested mechanics of bitcoin with the fun and lightweight agility of doge.

We have a [Disclosure Policy](DISCLOSURE_POLICY.md) for responsible disclosure

Further info
------------

See [doc/README.md](doc/README.md) for further info on installation, building, development, etc. We will try to make this as easy as possible for people but this will require some technical expertise and an ability to use a linux terminal. We owe a debt fo gratitude to Satoshi, the builders that sought to free the world, the cypherpunks and the cryptobros that got us all to where we are today. 

Dont be afraid, we believe in you.
